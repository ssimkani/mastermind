# mastermind

## Description and How to Play

This project is a re-creation of the game Mastermind where one player creates a code and the other player tries to guess it. The code is a sequence of 4 numbers between 1 and 6. The guesser enters their guess, and the creator of the code gives feedback in the form of "solid pegs" and "empty pegs". A "solid peg" represents a number in the guess that is in the present in the code and in the correct position. An "empty peg" represents a number in the guess that is present in the code but not in the correct position. 

solid pegs: "●"
empty pegs: "○"

 The guesser wins if they correctly guess. The game ends when the guesser correctly guesses the code. If the code breaker doesn't guess the correct code in 12 or less guesses, then the code maker is the winner.

The game is played in the command line. To play, run `ruby mastermind.rb`.

## What I Learned

The game is written in the Ruby programming language and is part of the Odin Project Curriculum.
I have demonstrated the following core programming skills:

* Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, and module mixins
* Knowledge of how to use methods to break up code into smaller, more manageable pieces
* Understanding of how to use loops and conditional statements to control the flow of a program
* Basic understanding of data types and how to work with them (e.g. strings, integers, arrays, etc.)
